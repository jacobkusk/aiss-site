-- Two overloads called from app code:
--   1. by mmsi                       → returns { coords, gaps } for the full track
--   2. by mmsi + [p_start, p_end]    → same shape, time-windowed with gaps
--                                      trimmed to the overlap
-- Both read the most recently compressed track for the entity.
--
-- The old (p_entity_id uuid) overload was dropped on 2026-04-16 — it had no
-- callers anywhere in src/ and was left over from the pre-UUID-migration era
-- when the app routed by entity_id directly. Add it back (and update this
-- header) the day something needs to fetch by entity_id instead of mmsi.

-- Overload 1: by mmsi — includes gap_intervals
